# Smart-Lock
In this project, I intended to create a reliable and efficient security system which should also be inexpensive and user friendly. This system is smartly able to classify the two main scenerio of access process i.e. authorized access and unauthorized access. 

To differentiate between the two I am performing a face recognition algorithm to match the user’s face with the registered faces in the system. For this, I am using a neural network and keras based algorithm which detects user’s face and matches it with the pre-registered faces. 

If the faces match the door will be opened for the user but if the faces don’t match we deploy a alert SMS to the owner of the house, the door is kept closed and an alarm is set off at the door in form of a high intensity buzzer to alert the neighbourhood to identify the unauthorized user trying to enter the house. So using this simple if-else situation in the scenario we are going to secure the house for the owner. The aim was to design a simple and effective system which I were able to achieve with this prototype. I have used the following applications to develop this prototype:

# Google Colab 
Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.

# Tinkercad
Tinkercad is a free, easy-to-use app for 3D design, electronics, and coding. It's used by teachers, kids, hobbyists, and designers to imagine, design, and make anything!

# ThingSpeak
ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform service that allows you to aggregate, visualize and analyze live data streams in the cloud. ThingSpeak provides instant visualizations of data posted by your devices to ThingSpeak

# Twilio
Twilio Messaging is an API to send and receive SMS, MMS, OTT messages globally. It uses intelligent sending features to ensure messages reliably reach end users wherever they are. Twilio has SMS-enabled phone numbers available in more than 180 countries
